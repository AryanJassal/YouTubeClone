# Build b20211103-01

## **Build Highlights**

An official changelog! Yay! This should (hopefully) serve as proof that I have high hopes for this project. The (one of the) most annoying issue of checkboxes not working in Markdown syntax was annoying, so that was fixed first.

## **New Features/Additions**

- Added official changelog
- Working on index page of YouTube.
  - Base colors added
  - Categories system added (note: needs selection on click)

## **Changes/Fixes**

- **checkboxes:** Markdown checkboxes now functional in README.md file.
- **favicon:** Removed the extra url pattern for favicon from urls.py file in core app. Now, it is implemented using HTML in the base.html template.
