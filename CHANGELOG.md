## **Build Highlights**

MAJOR BREAKTRHOUGH!! The issue with categories going off-screen is fixed. Now, to work on the categories not being the actual screen width and just being funky in general.

Oh, and also, I've added another icon library: `ico-icons` to my icon/UI library. Oh how I wish I had fontawesome pro.

## **New Features/Additions**

No changes/additions as of this update.

## **Changes/Fixes**

- Fixed the width of categories from going too wide.

## **Agenda For Next Update**

- Make the width play nice
- Add the arrows to scroll through categories again.
- Only show arrows if you can scroll in that direction
