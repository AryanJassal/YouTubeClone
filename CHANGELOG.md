# Build b20211109-02

## **Build Highlights**

Making some minor improvements and touch-ups. Oh, and I removed the scrolling with the mouse wheel.

## **Release Notes**

I have removed the horizontal scrolling of the categories because it is half-assed, and it would give me nightmares if I just left it as-is. I feel way better knowing that the scrolling is actually non-functional, and I would have to properly fix it later down the line.

## **New Features/Additions**

None for this update/release

## **Changes/Fixes**

- Removed horizontal scrolling for categories

## **Agenda For Next Update**

- Only show arrows if you can scroll in that direction
- Start making the mainpage with video and thumbnails
- Build the skeleton for topnav (searching, accounts, etc.)
- Add smooth horizontal scrolling for categories
- Clean up css code
- Clean up html code
