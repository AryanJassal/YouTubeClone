# Build b20211108-01

## **Build Highlights**

ANOTHER MAJOR BREAKTRHOUGH!! It's finally fixed!! Everything plays nice.

## **New Features/Additions**

- Added the category navigation arrows (again)

## **Changes/Fixes**

- Fixed the width of categories

## **Agenda For Next Update**

- Only show arrows if you can scroll in that direction
- Make the arrows actually functional

## Notes

For anyone wondering how I fixed it, it was a really dumb fix. I just needed to add `min-width: 0 !important;` to the `.sidenav-container` and it worked like a charm!

P.S. I know that only I will look at it, so it's more for my future reference than actually for people.
