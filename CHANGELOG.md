## **Build Highlights**

Minor quality change: pixelated image in Chrome fixed. Also, completely off-topic but the menu toggle is working! I'm still tearing my own head off because I can't fix the goddamn sizing problem.

## **New Features/Additions**

- Hamburger menu icon properly toggles the sidenav menu.

## **Changes/Fixes**

- Pixelated downscaled logo/image in Chrome fixed.

## **Agenda For Next Update**

- Fix scrolling of categories
- Fix width issue of page
- Only show arrows if you can scroll in that direction
- Find a way to get no `font-size: bold` for fontawesome icons.
