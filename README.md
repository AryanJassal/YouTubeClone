# YouTube Clone in Python Django

## Just what the heck is this??

This is still under development. I should have something to show here soon. Until then, satisfy yourself with the knowledge that this is a (yet another) clone of the popular video streaming service known as YouTube, which is currently maintained by Google. This clone will be made using Python 3 and the Django framework. This readme is just made as a stopgap for now. More content will be added later.

For more in-depth information on changes and releases, view the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/AryanJassal/YouTubeClone/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file.

Google please don't sue me this is just for learning. Yes, as far as I know, the term learning in this context loosely translates to 'Using for educational purposes only'.

Oh, and I should probably add this disclaimer: **Do not try this at home. Google may sue you.**

## Known Issues

I'm aware of these issues and I'm working on it! For a more comprehensive list (maybe?) view the changelog.

- [x] Favicon not showing up in Google Chrome but it shows up in Firefox (Note that the favicon in Chrome will not be loaded for local servers as that's just how Chrome works.)
- [ ] Fix the goddamn width of the entire *bleeping* categories container.
- [ ] Make the goddamn scroll thingy working.
- [ ] Fix the pixelated logo/image in chrome
- [ ] Find a way to get no `font-size: bold` for fontawesome icons.
