# YouTube Clone in Python Django

## Just what the heck is this??

You must have heard of YouTube, the most popular video streaming service (unless you live under a rock). This is an attempt to recreate YouTube, owned by Google, using Python 3 and Django Framework. You should be warned: this application is still under development and will be for quite a while.

This is a project I'm working on for more practice with Django and learning the ins-and-outs of this framework. Note that pull requests will not be accepted. This may change in the future (very unlikely).

For more in-depth information on changes and releases, view the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/AryanJassal/YouTubeClone/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file.

Google please don't sue me this is just for learning. Yes, as far as I know, the term learning in this context loosely translates to 'Using for educational purposes only'.

Oh, and I should probably add this disclaimer: **Do not try this at home. Google may sue you.**

## Notes

I'm aware of these *gotcha*'s, and you should be too.

- Site favicon will not show up in Google Chrome if you are using localhost (127.0.0.1) to host this website, although it does work in other browsers. (Tested only in Firefox)
