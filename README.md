# YouTube Clone in Python Django

## Just what the heck is this??

This is still under development. I should have something to show here soon. Until then, satisfy yourself with the knowledge that this is a (yet another) clone of the popular video streaming service known as YouTube, which is currently maintained by Google. This clone will be made using Python 3 and the Django framework. This readme is just made as a stopgap for now. More content will be added later.

## Known Issues

Yeah yeah I know these things are wrong with the site and I'm working on it!

- [x] Favicon not showing up in Google Chrome but it shows up in Firefox (Note that the favicon in Chrome will not be loaded for local servers as that's just how Chrome works.)
- [ ] Categories are interactive but aren't properly selectable (need to add js handler for onclick)
- [ ] Make the size of the sidenav constant like actual YouTube site.
