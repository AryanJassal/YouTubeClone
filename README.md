# Just what the heck is this??
This is still under development. I should have something to show here soon. Until then, satisfy yourself with the knowledge that this is a (yet another) clone of the popular video streaming service known as YouTube, which is currently maintained by Google. This clone will be made using Python 3 and the Django framework. This readme is just made as a stopgap for now. More content will be added later.

# Known Issues
Yeah yeah I know these things are wrong with the site and I'm working on it!
